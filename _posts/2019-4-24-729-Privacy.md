title: 729 Privacy Policy
---

Hello, I am the developer of 729, and I am required to write a privacy policy.

The privacy policy for the 729 android app is very simple. I don't save any user information at all.

If you choose to in game, you can sign in and participate in the leaderboards. Even if you make this choice, I don't save any user information. The leaderboards are handled by google play game services, which is a built in feature of the play store.
