Hello! I am a Maryland based computer scientist, and this is a place where I plan to share the computer related art projects and other hacks that I have worked on.


### More Information

I think my interest in creative coding started as a amateur game tester. When I played games, I preferred to try to find the exploits in the game mechanics, and I was involved in the community investigating bugs and oddities in the Halo 1 and 2 games.

Later I did this professionally for a time at Bethesda, working as a fulltime (and then some) QA tester, mostly on the game Skyrim.

I have always been more interested in the unfinished parts of the game vs the finished and polished parts. There is a sense of freedom and solitude and adventure in finding a way out of bounds into a place where the normal rules about what is possible and what is not can change.

Writing code to generate images or sounds or videos, is sort of like a path to a great open space, a great skybox beyond the bounds of normal play, where anything is possible, if you work hard enough to reach it.
